# Securing Data in Images using Advanced Encryption Standard

In today's digital age, the protection of sensitive information is of utmost importance. Data breaches and cyber attacks are on the rise, making it crucial to secure data effectively. This project presents a software tool developed in Python that employs the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and image steganography to encrypt text data and securely store it within images. This approach enhances data privacy and digital security by safeguarding confidential information from unauthorized access.

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: Utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt text data, ensuring strong data protection.

- **Image Steganography**: Employs image steganography techniques to hide encrypted data within images, making it inconspicuous.

- **Secure Data Storage**: Provides a secure and hidden storage mechanism for confidential information within image files.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The frontend of the application is built using the Streamlit library, offering a user-friendly experience.
